Hello, I’m Przemyslaw "Ober" Oberbek. I was a long term semi-pro Magic: the Gathering player. 
I'm writer, blogger and owner of the Psychatog.pl website about this collectible card game.
I’m interested in all kind of games and I want to change mu current scientific career to game industry. 
Now I'm learning Arduino programing (C/C++) for microcontrolers and Python for everything else. 
I also tried Twinery.org for some text based games since it's pretty great platform for planning simple projects.
