Hello, I’m Przemyslaw "Ober" Oberbek. I was a long term semi-pro Magic: the Gathering player. 
I'm writer, blogger and owner of the Psychatog.pl website about this collectible card game.
I’m interested in all kind of games and now, I'm switching from scientific career to a game industry. 
I know a little bit of Arduino programing (C/C++) for microcontrolers and just a small piece of Python for everything else. 
I also tried Twinery.org for some text based games since it's pretty great platform for planning simple projects.
